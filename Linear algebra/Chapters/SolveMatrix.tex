This chapter is about ``solving'' matrices. First of all, we need to be aware of what kind of thing we are really eager to know. And, we want to know why solving a matrix will be helpful for study the properties of the LT. \\

We first answer the second question, so that you will be more confident about what we will do next. Let me just claim several facts. 

\begin{definition}
    Given an LT $T$\\
    $$Ker(T) := \{\v \in V: T(\v)= \mathbf{0}\}$$
    $$Im(T):= \{\w \in W: \exists \v \in V, \ T(\v) = \w\}$$
\end{definition}
We have basically the same for matrices,
\begin{definition}
    Given a matrix $A$, we usually denote 
    $$Ker(A) = Nul(A),\ Im(A) = Col(A)$$
\end{definition}

In last chapter, we know a matrix can represent
